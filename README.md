OX

This project is an implementation of the game called Five in a row, or Gomoku. (Or OX according to the shape of the symbols used in the game.)

Most of the code was written in 2012 and 2013, when I was in high school. I did a considerable refactor in 2015. Additional minor changes and improvements was made in 2018.
The project was added to source control and published on GitHub in 2019. Though most of the code (and the user interface) is Hungarian and there is no available documentation.
